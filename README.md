`Coluna` is a branch-and-price-and-cut framework that decomposes and solves 
a mixed-integer program (MIP). The user introduces his "original" problem formulation using the [`JuMP`](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) modeling language and our specific extension
[`BlockDecomposition`](https://github.com/atoptima/BlockDecomposition.jl). 

`Coluna` reformulates the user problem based on the "annotations" provided along side the original formulation using `BlockDecomposition`.

`Coluna` aims to be very modular and tweakable so that any user can define the behavior of his customized branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm. The user can create its own algorithmic strategy using the algorithmic building blocks offered in `Coluna`.

## Installation

You can install Coluna.jl through the package manager of Julia. 
Go to the Pkg-REPL-mode using the key `]` from the Julia REPL. 
Then, run the following command :

```
   pkg> add https://github.com/atoptima/Coluna.jl.git
```

## Features & Roadmap

State-of-the-art features are continuously integrated into Coluna to achieve best performance on such
branch-and-cut-and-price approaches.

Here is a list of functionality that are implemented or will be in the near fueture. We aim to provide support for these.

- [x] Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition 
- [ ] Benders decomposition
- [ ] Mixed Dantzig-Benders decomposition
- [ ] Nested/Recursive decomposition
- [x] Column generation
- [ ] Cuts generation
- [x] Branch-and-price-and-cut customization
- [ ] Ad-hoc customised oracles for solving subproblems / separation routines
- [ ] Preprocessing specific to reformulated problems / cleaning up of large scale formulations 
- [ ] stabilisation and other convergence speed-up methods
- [ ] Strong-branching 
- [ ] Sepcialized branching schemes to colunn generation approaches
- [ ] Parallelisation of the Branch-and-Bound Tree Search
